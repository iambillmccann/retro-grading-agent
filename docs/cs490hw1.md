This assignment is for setting up two tools that you will be using nearly every day for this class. The first is joining our class Discord server, and the second is creating a GitHub account; that is, creating a GitHub account if you don't already have one, which you should.

Our Discord server is "CS 490-102 2026 Spring" and you join can at this link: https://discord.gg/UXwHCDFq 
You can join GitHub for free at: https://github.com 

Once you have joined the Discord server and GitHub create a text file named [lastname]-[firstname].json. As an example, my file name would be mccann-bill.json. Inside that type a json object in this form:

```
{
   "name": "Bill McCann",
   "ucid": "wfm8",
   "discordId": "iambillmccann",
   "githubId": "iambillmccann"
}
```

Of course you should use your values for name, discordId, and githubId. And since this is a json object, the key names (name, discordId, githubId) are case sensitive.

BTW, be sure that you can be tagged using the discordId that you provide. Example: @iambillmccann will tag me in a Discord chat. Also make sure that you set your Nameplate Preview to your actual name; do that by editing your profile.

When done, submit the file on Canvas.

Grading rubric:

1. Name the file correctly (1 point)
2. Well formed json (1 point)
3. Key names correctly specified (1 point)
4. Add values supplied (2 points)
